I have created a new version of the game Wordly in Python.

How it works:

1) You download 2 files that are attached to the repository, they are called russian.dict and english.dict
2) You must move these files to the root folder of Python. Path to the file (example): C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311
3) When you have moved both files you can download the program itself (you will need to move it to the same place)
4) When you start the program, you will be asked the language in which you want to play. If you select Russian, you will automatically have the Russian system language and Russian dictionary of words connected.
5) After selecting the language, you can choose 1 of 3 proposed difficulty levels or customize all parameters for yourself in custom mode
6) Now you need to guess the hidden word in a certain number of attempts. Good luck!

Innovations:
1) Wordley Helper file appeared. It works very simply: You enter what your word looks like, then you enter what letters are present in the word. After that, you are given a list of words that match your requirements.
2) Now the list of words that can appear is huge, so the words will differ from each other with a probability of 99.99%

This was a very short guide on how to use this program. A detailed guide with examples of games is available at the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
